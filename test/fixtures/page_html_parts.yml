    "Self-similarity":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity is the defining characteristic of the music generated by this website. Just as self-similarity can be applied to geometric shapes, it can also be applied to a music. You can apply self-similarity to any or all of these aspects of the germ:

    * *Pitch*: "Scalar transposition":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(music)#Two_different_types will be applied to each note of the germ, based on the shape of the germ. The effect will be similar to a "sequence":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_%28music%29.
    * *Rhythm*: The rhythms of each part of the phrase will be scaled based on the rhythmic shape of the germ.
    * *Volume*: The volumes of each part of the phrase will be scaled based on the dynamic shape of the germ.

    Note that inversion and/or retrograde, as specified by the section or voice section, will be applied to the germ before self-similarity is applied.

    Specifies the scale type and key to use. Generally speaking, you should make sure that all of the notes of your germ are part of the selected scale and key. Notes that are not part of the scale will create excessively dissonant sections.

    If you are trying to minimize dissonance, consider using one of the pentatonic scales. This will eliminate the most dissonant intervals (minor seconds, major sevenths and tritones), as long as all the notes in your germ are part of the selected pentatonic scale.
