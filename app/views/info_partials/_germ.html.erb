<p>
  Specifies the short melody from which the piece is generated. 
  You can think of it as the “shape” of the fractal. 
  The germ should be a series of notes, seperated by spaces.

<p>
  Each note should be of the following form:
</p>
<p>
  &lt;pitch class&gt;&lt;octave&gt;,&lt;duration fraction&gt;,&lt;volume&gt;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_class">Pitch Class</a>: A letter name (A-G), 
      optionally followed by an accidental (bb, b, # or x).
    </li>
    <li>
      Octave: A number from 0 to 9 specifying which octave this note is in. The 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation">Acoustical 
      Society of America’s octave designation system</a> is used. Each octave runs 
      from C to B. C4 to B4 is the octave from middle C to the B above middle C.
    </li>
    <li>
      Duration Fraction (optional): A fraction indicating how long the note should last. 
      For example, 1/4 indicates a quarter note, 3/8 a dotted quarter note and 
      1/12 indicates one note of an eighth note triplet. If no duration is given, 
      the duration of the previous note is used. The first note will be a quarter 
      note if no duration is given.
    </li>
    <li>
      Volume (optional): One of <span class="caps">PPP</span>, PP, P, MP, MF, F, FF or 
      <span class="caps">FFF</span>. If none is given, the volume of the previous 
      note is used. The first note will be MF if no volume is given.
    </li>
</ul>
