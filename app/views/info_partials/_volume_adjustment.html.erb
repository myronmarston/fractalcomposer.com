<p>
  Indicates how much to increase or decrease the volume. Values between 0.0 and 
  1.0 increase the volume; values between 0.0 and -1.0 decrease it.
</p>

<p>
  For example, a value of 0.5 means that the volume should be increased to 
  halfway between the current volume and the maximum volume. A value of -0.5 
  means the volume should be decreased to halfway between the existing volume 
  and the minimum volume.

<p>
  Be careful about setting this to values close to -1.0; the result will be 
  virtually inaudible.
