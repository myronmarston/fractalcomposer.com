  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-similarity">Self-similarity</a> 
  is the defining characteristic of the music generated by this website. 
  Just as self-similarity can be applied to geometric shapes, it can also 
  be applied to a music. You can apply self-similarity to any or all of 
  these aspects of the germ:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Pitch</strong>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_%28music%29#Two_different_types">Scalar transposition</a> will be applied to each note of the germ, based on the shape of the germ. The effect will be similar to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_%28music%29">sequence</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: The rhythms of each part of the phrase will be scaled based on the rhythmic shape of the germ.</li>
    <li><strong>Volume</strong>: The volumes of each part of the phrase will be scaled based on the dynamic shape of the germ.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that inversion and/or retrograde, as specified by the section or voice section, 
  will be applied to the germ before self-similarity is applied.
